Draft Application

To,
The Superintendent of Police,
Meerut, Uttar Pradesh

Subject: Application for registration of FIR

Respected Sir/Madam,

I am Parth, a 55-year-old male resident of Football Chawk, Meerut. I am writing to inform you that I was stabbed in the stomach with a knife by an unknown person on 2023-09-04 at 03:33 PM at Football Chawk. The assailant robbed me and ran away.

I was returning home from work when the incident took place. I was walking alone on the road when I was attacked from behind. The assailant stabbed me once in the stomach and then snatched my bag, which contained my wallet and mobile phone. He then ran away.

I was rushed to a nearby hospital, where I was treated for my injury. I am now recovering at home.

I have no idea who the assailant is or why he attacked me. I have no witnesses or evidence to identify him. However, I am requesting you to register an FIR against the unknown assailant and investigate the matter.

I am also submitting a medical certificate to support my claim.

Thank you for your time and attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
Parth
